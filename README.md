# Riemann-Sum-Calculator
High School AP Calculus BC, 2014, extra credit project

About midway through my BC Calculus class, my teacher offered an extra credit opportunity in an attempt to cement students' understandings behind Integrals. The project is usually to create a 3D representation of sums using paper and cardboard. He knew that me and a good friend of mine were in our school's third year post AP CS class, and said he would enjoy seeing what we code for him if we included explanations for our functions. This webpage calculates several types of Riemann Sums given that the user includes the integrands and bounds
